Bismillah, this will be the first big project for Java that i'll be doing.
its called the MultiApp.

For Best Experience :
- enlarge the window
- use console program that lets you use colors (ex : cmder app)
- If you use Command Prompt Console, you then must use the multiAppAlt.class

[You need to have JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 11 or newer installed before opening this app or it won't work!]

to open the file :

Using Cmder program (WIP)(DONT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS)
1. First open command prompt
2. Type   cd (the class adress where there is multiApp.class)
ex : cd C:\Users\USER\Multi App V. 0.0.1.5
3. press enter
4. Type   java (class name)
in this case, we type    java multiApp
5. press enter
6. It should be opened now! Have fun!

Using Command Prompt program
1. First open command prompt
2. Type   cd (the class adress where there is multiAppAlt.class)
ex : cd C:\Users\USER\Multi App V. 0.0.1.5
3. press enter
4. Type   java (class name)
in this case, we type    java multiAppAlt
5. press enter
6. It should be opened now! Have fun!

The main idea is to make an app/program that can be used for many purposes

the current idea is to develop:
- Calculator (many types of calculators)
- A story game (enter your input)
- A puzzle game
- A notepad
- Art using Java
